# Caesars Cipher

## Requirements
- One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
- A common modern use is the - `ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.
- Write a function which takes a - `ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
- All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

## Tests
- `rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC")` should decode to FREE CODE CAMP
